## Quarto

Quarto enables you to weave together content and executable code into a finished document. To learn more about Quarto see <https://quarto.org>.

## Running Code

When you click the **Render** button a document will be generated that includes both content and the output of embedded code. You can embed code like this:

```{r}
library(RedditExtractoR)

test <- find_thread_urls(subreddit = "tarheels", sort_by = "new", period = "day")
```

You can add options to executable code like this

```{r}
#| echo: false
# Shekinah's scratch 

college_sentiments <- all_word_sentiments |>
  group_by(subreddit) |>
  summarize(
    total_sentiment = sum(sentiment, na.rm = TRUE),
    .groups = "drop"
  )
#summary table of total sentiments by colleges
college_sentiments |>
  gt() |>
  tab_header(title = "Total Sentiment by College") |>
  cols_label(
    subreddit = "College",
    total_sentiment = "Total Sentiment Score"
  )
# Bar chart of total sentiment Vs Colleges(subreddit) 
ggplot(college_sentiments, aes(x = reorder(subreddit, total_sentiment), y = total_sentiment, fill = total_sentiment)) +
  geom_col() +
  coord_flip() +
  labs(
    title = "Total Sentiment by College",
    x = "College",
    y = "Total Sentiment Score"
  ) +
  theme_minimal()
# Anove test and anova table 
anova_result <- aov(sentiment ~ subreddit, data = all_word_sentiments)
anova_table <- tidy(anova_result)
anova_table |>
  gt() |>
  tab_header(
    title = "ANOVA: Sentiment Differences by College"
  ) |>
  cols_label(
    term = "Source",
    df = "DF",
    sumsq = "Sum of Squares",
    meansq = "Mean Square",
    statistic = "F-value",
    p.value = "p-value"
  )

# Word clouds for the three colleges 
set.seed(43)
ggplot(word_tfidf, aes(label = word, size = tf_idf)) +
  geom_text_wordcloud() +
  facet_wrap(~ college) + 
  theme_minimal()
```

The `echo: false` option disables the printing of code (onlyndefined output is displayed).
