    <p>How does sentiment flow through the online communities of college students? What topics are most important to each group, and how have these conditions fluctuated with time? In this project, we dive into the world of Reddit, analyzing the emotional tone, engagement, and content of posts across three NESCAC college subreddits: Amherst, Middlebury, and Williams. By obtaining data in real-time using the <span class="citation" data-cites="rivera_ivan">Rivera (<a href="#ref-rivera_ivan" role="doc-biblioref">2025</a>)</span> RedditExtractoR scraping package, we examine positive negative valence, comment count, and content themes both over time and as a totality across the three forums. The goal is to explore within and cross subreddit patterns together to see if any discrepancies or global similarities emerge. Through text analysis and statistical modeling, we study how the words of students manifest the sentiment and thematic spectrum of their communities and how sentiment translates to engagement, with a particular focus on dicussions surrounding the admissions process.</p>

<p>If you are unfamiliar with <a href="https://www.reddit.com/">Reddit.com</a>, we may have to begin by inquiring about the rock you’ve been living under for nigh-on two decades. In all seriousness (don’t stop reading, we’re sorry), along with X, the forum-based social media platform is a primary hub for commentary on any issue you could think of (for better or for worse). It is this plethora of unfiltered content that makes Reddit a commonly visited site for web scrapers and data scientist nerds alike with a variety of goals including but not limited to: theme and topic discovery, sentiment and engagement analysis, and user activity research. Our current data science project is spurred by similar motivations; we look to extract key topics and conduct sentiment analysis (positive or negative valence of a text) for three individual subreddits: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/amherstcollege/">Amherst College</a>, <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/middlebury/">Middlebury College</a>, and <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/WilliamsCollege/">Williams College</a>. Specifically, we aim to compare the sentiments meaningfully of each subreddit, as both a per-post average and a totality, examine temporal trends in sentiment and comment engagement, extract the most frequently discussed topics, and, because we are looking at colleges here, and track mentions of the admissions process.</p>

<p>You may be wondering why we picked these specific subreddits and what this project can tell us in the grand scheme of things. As students at Amherst College, we thought it would be particularly fun to compare our own subreddit to that of some of our least favorite sister schools in the NESCAC. On a more practical basis, these three subreddits were small enough for us to be able to scrape all posts until January 2020 with no issues. In regards to our purpose, even if you are not a current student in the NESCAC who may get a kick out of pitting Amherst, Middlebury, and Williams against each other, our analysis provides insights into what is being discussed and prioritized at these different institutions, along with an assessment of their varying levels of positivity. We think of prospective students as one group who might be interested in our results, as well as anyone curious about the state of the small liberal arts colleges (at least from Reddit’s perspective).</p>

<h1>RedditExtractoR</h1>
<p>Web scraping is a notoriously error-laden path. As websites increasingly deploy dynamically rendered data and IP address blocking, it has never been harder to get the data you want. Luckily, we found a tool that could scrape up to 1000 posts per request. The <span class="citation" data-cites="rivera_ivan">Rivera (<a href="#ref-rivera_ivan" role="doc-biblioref">2025</a>)</span> RedditExtractoR scraping package gives a post’s title, content, number of comments, and date, all in as little as 3 lines of R code:</p>

<section id="methods-for-sentiment-analysis" class="level1">
<h1>Methods for Sentiment Analysis</h1>
<p>Once we scraped each subreddit, we joined all the posts into one big dataset and assigned a sentiment score to the content of each post. This score was calculated using the Afinn Lexicon, which maps words to integer values between -5 and 5 based on their positive-negative valence (for more information, see <span class="citation" data-cites="Zhang">Zhang (<a href="#ref-Zhang" role="doc-biblioref">n.d.</a>)</span>). The score for each post simply became the sum of the sentiments for the words that comprised it. Further documentation of our methods will be laid out as we delve into our specific efforts below, but if you want to explore the general dataset that we created and used throughout the project, see <a href="#fig-raw-data" class="quarto-xref">Figure&nbsp;2</a> at the end of this blog. What you are seeing here are the results of recent, applicable, and primary-sourced data!</p>

exactly does the housing system work? does amherst help international students get jobs after graduation, especially if one can't get a work permit in the us? also, how good is the studio/fine arts department, it looks pretty new. does amherst arrange transport to and from the international airport? how exactly does the five college consortium work? can one do a major/minor at those colleges or only short courses?","to students applying to amherst college hi everyone! i know stuff is kind of hectic now, and it's especially difficult to visit campus to check it out, so i thought i'd offer to

i surely want good academics and a good job, but i also want to make some fun and nostalgic memories here for my lifetime which i couldn't do during my 12-year school life.\n2. is there any stem and tech-focused societies or clubs which do personal projects and participate in different competitions? or is it possible to find similar-minded motivated students? i will probably major in either cs or physics. in other universities, students of both majors independently collaborate on personal design projects like developing a machine learning framework for detecting drug resistance or creating a software for biomedical robotics, things like that. are amherst students engaged in this kind of club and design activities? can i find similar-minded students and enough resources to work on personal design projects and teachers to mentor (i have personal wishes to develop a software for helping disabled people and another computer program to develop drug delivery system and participate in various tech competitions like microsoft imagine cup, biomod design competition etc. that's why i am curious if i will find proper teammates and resources)?\n3. everybody says at a small school like amherst, it is way easier to land research positions. but is it really that easy? what should one do if he wants to land an independent position during any random semester in the 1st or 2nd year (not as part of the surf)?\n4. another question about research, how broad and diverse are the research scopes and areas? like at big research universities, students do research like it is a regular eca. and the labs they work on are so diversified. a junior year girl i know from mit studying cs, during her stay on the campus, she worked on a data science project led by a professor of mit sloan business school, then did another research at the mit's kavli astrophysics research institute and worked on a machine learning project regarding cell function in space, then did another research at mit broad institute on machine learning for detecting antibiotic resistance. so none of her research labs were part of the cs department but she got cs related research jobs at so many labs, the opportunities were not limited to only cs labs or professors. is it possible to find this kind of diverse position at diverse labs at amherst?\n5. i know its perks, but still want to hear from a student who had real experiences. what are the benefits you got for being small classes and how much attention you really got from professors as an individual student?\n6. any notable employers (any field- finance, business, cs, tech) which come to or regularly recruit amherst students?

(this might be determined by what type of stuff u guys do on weekends or just what kinda vibes permeate the culture) - also for reference i really loved wesleyan for its vibrant arts scene (literally everyone is involved in some sorta arts and its the main focus of the social scene) but decided against it bc amherst and stanford are just better academics.\n2. more specific but do you know how good and also how friendly the women's club soccer team is? i got an offer to play d3 at another nescac but turned it down cuz i didn't want to be bound to the soccer team cuz what if i didn't like the team yk (i'm socially anxious can u tell lol) also i didnt want a giant time commitment\n3. i heard the drama clubs are essentially dead and waiting for someone to come and revive them. this is a downside for me as i love theater people and just want to be part of low stakes productions for funzies (such as they have at stanford). will i get that at amherst if i join some of the bigger productions even if the drama clubs are \"dead?\" (btw i'm not that good at it i just love it and i love the social aspect of it)\n4. how much does the weather affect general happiness levels? oregon weather is pretty mild in comparison and ofc california is gorgeous. i am worried im gonna get depressed af for 5 months but i've never expereinced new england weather so idk.\n5. also can anyone speak to the queer presence on campus? i know it's there but is it more like the mayor pete/ben platt type queers who can basically pass as straight (this relates to the more \"buttoned up\" impression i got)? also keep in mind i'm from portland oregon so basically any amount of queer presence is less than i'm used to lol\n6. am i gonna be lonely?

my daughter says if she studies art it would be art history (she loves) or creative writing (she's interested in further exploring). but her passion is science and it's what she wants to lead with. she attended a new, small, private high school her freshman year, but they had a horrible science curriculum. like almost non-existent. but she's on track to take ap chem, ap precalc...she likely won't be taking ap spanish &amp; the school only offers honors english (which she takes now as a sophomore)for her 11th grade, &amp; ap english/literature senior year. she is a member of hosa at her high school &amp; she's applying for an internship at udub (we're in seattle area) &amp; looking at polygence for remote research projects. we're getting a psat baseline so we can get a tutor or go online to strengthen whatever needs doing. so far i think she has gpa just under a 4.0, like *just*. long story long, her advisor has suggested target schools that vary quite a bit in acceptance rates - which makes sense. however she seems to want to dissuade my daughter from the more competitive ones. on one hand she says amherst is reeeeally hard to get into, but then she suggests others with similar acceptance rates (argh). my girl is looking at amherst (advisor suggested umass as well), vassar, lehigh, william &amp; mary. if any of you got this far, i'd be so grateful for any feedback you might have. my girl is hardworking, outgoing, kind, articulate &amp; very bright. she is also planning on picking the two she likes best for ed 1 &amp; 2 (when she knows what she wants, she knows!). she is also 1st gen (is that not obvious yet?)...anything really, thank you in advance!","amherst fin aid portal - bank cert for all assets?

also, williams has the oxford-style tutorials which seem dope.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nthe alumni network also matters to me a lot since i am strongly considering entering ib/consulting after school. i've heard that both schools are targets and that both have fiercely loyal alumni. however, dartmouth has a much larger pre-professional vibe to it and there are a lot more people in investment banking and consulting that came from dartmouth than williams. while dartmouth is a stronger target and sends more kids to top firms each year, there are a lot more kids that want to go do down the path of finance/consulting so there may be less competition at williams making it easier to break in. i don't really know which is better, but i would say maybe dartmouth because they have more resources for these students but i would appreciate any insight that students or alumni have at each school.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nthis is kinda unique to dartmouth but i don't know whether the d-plan is on net good or bad. i've heard that it can open you up to taking internships or research positions in unorthodox times when there is a lot less competition which sounds cool. sophomore summer and \"camp dartmouth\" sound cool too. i've heard people say it makes academic life easier but others have said it's made it a lot more fast-paced and requires tons of work to keep up with. i've also heard it can rip friendships apart since differences in schedules means you could go a whole year without seeing a friend.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nin terms of the campuses, i, unfortunately, do not have the opportunity to visit either williams or dartmouth. architecture and the \"look\" of a school matter to me a lot though. i really like the rural vibes of both the schools. if anyone can comment on the vibes of each campus that would be great.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nin terms of social life, both again say they foster community and collaboration over competition. however, the people at williams seem a lot more chill and friendly than the people at dartmouth, which i've perceived to have a very preppy vibe to it and a lot more fake people. idk tho that's just what i've picked up from the vlogs i've watched and things i've heard. williams concerns me a bit because i have heard the social scene can be very dead, with most people studying all weekend. however, dartmouth also concerns me due to the huge prevalence of binge drinking culture and partying.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nthat brings me to greek life. from what i have heard, dartmouth seems to downplay it but over 60% of people are members of some sort of greek life organization. i have tried to look up stuff online about frats but couldn't find much. i don't really think i would enjoy frats and i'm even more concerned since if admitted i will be on lots of financial aid so i don't know if i'll be able to afford to join one if i wanted to down the road. i have also heard some frats have stronger alumni connections than normal students have access to, which is also concerning. i'm just all around very apprehensive of the whole system.\n\n&amp;#x200b;\n\nlastly, i know this is really stupid, but the ivy league prestige is also something that is very enticing to me, especially since nobody really knows much about williams but most people know about dartmouth. i am aware that my perception of prestige is probably different from future employers, but i was wondering if the ivy league branding that comes with dartmouth really matters in the future?\n\ni would appreciate any insight from anyone, especially if they had to choose between williams and dartmouth, or one of those schools and another top school. thank you in advance to all who reply!","clear skies over campus ","rugby (and other club sports) at williams?

i read that 40% of all undergraduate students double major at williams, but how much flexibility do students *really* have? i got accepted for political science but i'm considering adding economics and pursuing consulting after college.\n5. one of the biggest drawbacks for me is that williams doesn't accept any ap scores or college credits. i've taken (and will be taking) a total of \\~15 ap tests with passing scores, and also another 10 college classes that would satisfy 75% of community college requirements in california. i could skip 1 to 1.5 years of cc requirements, but weighing that against a 4-year williams education is rough... has anyone else been in a similar situation before?\n6. the feeling and sense of a community are super important to me. how active are the debating team or the south asian students' association? i come from an asian-dominated county, city, and school. i'm open to all demographics and realize that williams contains an entirely different cultural dynamic. how active are associations like sasa, and how big does their membership tend to be?

what does the process look like? does it involve emailing former students at williams? is this the same as the ephlink mentoring website? also, since a large percentage of williams alumni take jobs in boston, are there alumni that help connect you with opportunities in the west coast or southeastern united states?
